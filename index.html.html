				<h2>Style, influences and legacy</h2>

				<p>Korn is identified as the pioneers of nu metal music, a form of alternative metal music which began in the mid-1990s. While generally considered an alternative metal and nu metal band, the band has also been labeled as heavy metal, grunge, hard rock, rap metal, funk metal, groove metal and industrial metal. Their debut album mixed metal, funk, hip-hop, groove, and dissonance. Their lyrics focus on pain and personal alienation rather than traditional heavy metal themes. In Nu-metal: The Next Generation of Rock & Punk, Korn was marked as the third biggest nu metal band in the world.</p>

				<p>Korn's influences include Primus, Alice in Chains, Pantera, Cypress Hill, Ice Cube, N.W.A, Rage Against the Machine, Sepultura, Bauhaus, Geto Boys, Van Halen, the Pharcyde, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Faith No More, Metallica, Nine Inch Nails, Deftones, Dr. Dre, and Mr. Bungle. A lot of Korn's work has been inspired by hip hop music, as suggested in the band's song "All in the Family" and the cover song of Ice Cube's "Wicked". Regarding their influences, bassist Fieldy stated "The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin — those bands haven’t influenced us in any way. Nobody in the band ever listened to that stuff. Our musical history starts with the Red Hot Chili Peppers and early Faith No More. As a band, that’s where we begin."</p>
